## How To Install 
In the scripts folder there are different type of shell commands.
First run the configure file then the build file. 
If you want to install it onto your system at the path (/usr/bin/), so that you can run it anywhere in your terminal firstly ensure 
you are in super user mode (sudo) and then run the install file, and now that it is installed all you have to do is enter MFF in the terminal 
and the program will be launched.   
If you choose not to do so just simply run the run file.
